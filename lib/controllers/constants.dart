  String story = "OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER";
  String storyDetails =
      """Our love story began in the hallways of the High school which we both attended, where laughter and friendship brought us together in ways we never imagined. Back then, she playfully dubbed me her "school father", a role that seemed unlikely since we were classmates. Yet, I embraced the title, curious about the layers it might add to our connection.
We became inseparable best friends, and as the years went by, we discovered that our bond held more depth and strength than mere friendship.\n
After graduation, life led us down separate paths, testing the strength of what we’d built. We found ourselves in different cities; Uyo, Calabar, Port Harcourt, Adamawa, Abuja, and Lagos, yet our connection was never weakened by distance. Each mile apart made our hearts grow fonder, and the miles only added to our story, teaching us patience, resilience, and the importance of truly cherishing each other.
During those years apart, we both focused on our personal growth and faith, nurturing our relationship with God as much as our love for each other. There were moments of longing, times of doubt, and seasons where the miles felt like oceans. But every phone call, every message, every memory we shared kept the spark alive, carrying us through the tough days and building a foundation of trust, loyalty, and unyielding love.
We've faced countless challenges, learned from each setback, and celebrated each triumph. Through every high and low, we've held onto each other and our shared faith, always believing in the future God has prepared for us. Now, as we stand side by side, serving the Lord together, we feel a deep gratitude for the journey that brought us here.\n
Our love story is one of friendship that blossomed into a profound, enduring love, one that neither time nor distance could diminish. We’ve patiently waited, trusted in God's timing, and today, we know that every step was leading us here—together, forever, and with a love stronger than we ever imagined.
